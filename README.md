# Trello Clone

## Overview

This application is designed to be a todo tracker that can be helpful when tracking things for a project while using Scrum or Agile.

I have implemented adding and deleteing of folders and tasks as well as draging and droping to allow for any team to customize how there workflow is done.

## Use

The folder title is grababble and the user can drag it left or right to change position with the other folders.

The task titles are also grababble can be moved withing the folder it lives or moved to another folder.

## install

- Fork this Repository
- Clone Forked Repository
- npm start to run

## Technologies

This project is built on React. I have intergrated bootstrap as a css library. I have also add Rreact beautiful drag and drop to allow the taks and folders to be moved dynamically.

## Going Forward

I would like to convert this project to Typescript as well as add a backend with a basic database to make this a full stack project.
